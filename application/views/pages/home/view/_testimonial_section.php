									families during our stay the resort the management is so kind that they treat us
									like their own families the beach is very beautiful and mesmerizing this is the
									best place to make new memories and take photos. We stay for 1 week and for me
									it is still short I miss the beach already and the peace of mind it offers. I
									recommend booking a reservation here it is truly worth it 10/10 experience for
									me.</p>

								<p class="mb-4">Villa Balinmanok is an ideal place for inner peace, the resort is
									quiet and perfect for taking a break from work or academics. Their amenities is
									a little bit overpriced but the experience is worth it. Everybody was
									accomodating and friendly,guests will stay at houses not just rooms depending on
									how many will check in. They have a store where guests can buy small things. But
									the market is really far from the place, so if you'll be staying for two days or
									more you'll need to bring your own stock of food.</p>

								<p class="mb-4">I could say the resort’s services were great! Because they’ve let us
									use their cooking materials for free which is what we really needed because we
									forgot to bring some. Even though the resort is a little bit far from the
									convenience stores, they are complete with stuff so it isn’t really a problem
									for us buying the things we need. The resort also is very generous for they’ve
									let us do an early check-in. We just experienced some unforeseen problems like
									the resort suddenly went out of power.</p>

								<p class="mb-4">The resort was a good destination to stay and chill. The service
									makes us comfortable and less hassle because we cook our food in the resort and
									they have complete cooking utensils to use. The resort provides a refrigerator,
									so we don't need to buy ice from them because it's expensive. The staff of the
									resort is very polite and if you need something they will give it to you right
									away. The amenities they have, like the kayak, were a good experience for us,
